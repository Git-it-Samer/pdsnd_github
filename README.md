### Project Title
Explore Bikeshare Data

### Description
This project involves students to apply what they learned from Udacity's Python lesson to explore Divvy's bikeshare data for three major cities. Students would write code to import the data and answer specific questions about it by computing descriptive statistics and write a script that uses the raw data and allows users to have an interactive experience
with the application of filters and viewing specific data that the user chooses.

### Files used
The files used for this project include:

  * washington.csv
  * chicago.csv
  * new_york_city.csv

### Credits
For the display_raw_data function, I got help with json material from w3resource.com and its pandas dataframes section.
