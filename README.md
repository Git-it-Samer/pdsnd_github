# Udacity Data Science Nanodegree Course

## Project 1 - DVD Rentals

### Date created
January 27, 2020

### Project Title
DVD Rentals Database

### Description
In this project, students will use SQL to explore a database related to movie rentals. They'll write SQL code to run SQL queries and answer interesting questions about the database. As part of the project submission, students will run SQL queries and build visualizations to showcase the output of their queries. The Sakila Database holds information about a company that rents movie DVDs. Students will be querying the database to gain an understanding of the customer base, such as what the patterns in movie watching are across different customer groups, how they compare on payment earnings, and how the stores compare in their performance.

### Files used
The files used for this project include:

  * DVD Rental ER Diagram
  * Sakilla Database


## Project 2 - Bikeshare Data

### Date created
March 13, 2020

### Project Title
Explore Bikeshare Data

### Description
This project involves students to apply what they learned from Udacity's Python lesson to explore Divvy's bikeshare data for three major cities. Students would write code to import the data and answer specific questions about it by computing descriptive statistics; also, writing a script using the raw data, allowing an interactive experience with the application of filters and viewing specific data that the user chooses.

### Files used
The files used for this project include:

  * washington.csv
  * chicago.csv
  * new_york_city.csv

### Credits
For the 'display_raw_data function', I got help with json material from w3resource.com and its 'pandas dataframes' section.
